// View Customer Profile
// 
// Event Description:
// A customer profile is a view that represents customers on CashApp.
// This replaces the threaded view as a way for the current user to
// see more context and have confidence in who they're sending to.
// 
// Point of Trigger:
// When the view is loaded and we have all the contextual information we need,
// i.e. after we've loaded a response from GetProfileDetails.
message ViewCustomerProfile {
  // The external_id that is sent in the InitiatePaymentRequest.
  // This id is generated client-side and can be used to tie events
  // that happen before a payment is created to server side payment events.
  // In profile we'll either take an external_id that already exists in the
  // recipient selector, or create a new one for when a profile precedes Quick Pay.
